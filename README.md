# 4Ampersand RPG: Project Week
## Overview
This is the repo for Team 4Ampersands' project week project.

## Premise
### "Who can get the highest score delving into the dungeon?"
A bunch of adventurers hang out in a bar. There's a dungeon nearby. They take turns going
into it and seeing who can get the furthest. Whoever gets the most gold wins.

## Getting Started
4Ampersands: Clone the repo and code, code, code!

Anyone else: Take a look around. This is a work in progress, and will be in various states of completion over the course of the week.
