                Stop me if you've heard this one: A troll, a human and an immortal walk into a bar... But seriously... here's the premise:<br>
                Three adventurers with varying backgrounds meet up in the local Alchemist's Guild.<br>
                The locals are murmuring excitedly about a nearby dungeon brimming with monsters and treasure, and the adventurers take it upon
                themselves to rise to the challenge!<br>One fights for freedom... another for gold and glory... and one fights to eradicate the dark
                scourge of peanuts!
            </p>

            <h4>Who can defeat the monsters and walk away with the most gold?</h4>

            <h4>Will they live to fight on another day, or perish in the dungeon?</h4>
