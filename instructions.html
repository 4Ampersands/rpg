            <h1>The Story</h1>

            <p>
                Three adventurers with varying backgrounds meet up in the local bar, the Alchemist's Tavern.<br>
                The locals are murmuring excitedly about a nearby dungeon brimming with monsters and treasure, and the adventurers take it upon
                themselves to rise to the challenge!<br>
                One fights for freedom... another for gold and glory... and one fights to eradicate the dark
                scourge of peanuts!
            </p>


            <h4>Who can defeat the monsters and walk away with the most gold?</h4>

            <h4>Will they live to fight on another day, or perish in the dungeon?</h4>

            <h2>YOU DECIDE! Welcome to Dungeon Fellows!</h2>

            <h1 id="how-to">How to Play</h1>

            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        </div>

        <div id="instruct">
            <ul>
                <li>Select a character to play. Each character has different inherent strengths and unique abilities.</li>
                <li>Select a special item for your character. These are unique for each character and affect game play in various ways.</li>
                <li>Items might be single-use (and powerful!) or they may be perpetual (and less powerful).  Choose wisely!</li>
                <li>Beware: This game is "hardcore mode" from the beginning.  If you die, the game is over, and your score is 0.</li>
                <li>When you encounter a monster, you have three choices: fight, flee, or use special item (if available).</li>
                <li>If you choose to fight, and you survive, your HP ("health score") will be adjusted, and you will gain treasure in the form of gold.</li>
                <li>If you choose to flee, the game ends, but you keep your gold.</li>
                <li>Whomever has the most gold (and survives) wins the game! Scores for former adventures are kept on the leaderboard.</li>
                <li>Ready to enter the dungeon and see how far you can make it?</li>
            </ul>
