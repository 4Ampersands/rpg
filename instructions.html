    <h1>How to Play</h1>

    <p>Instructions:<br></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select a character to play. Each character has different inherent strengths and unique abilities.</li>
            <li>Select a special item for your character. These are unique for each character and affect gameplay in various ways.</li>
            <li>Items might be single-use (and powerful!) or they may be perpetual (and less powerful).  Choose wisely!</li>
            <li>Beware: This game is "hardcore mode" from the beginning.  If you die, the game is over, and your score is 0.</li>
            <li>When you encounter a monster, you have three choices: fight, flee, or use special item (if available).</li>
            <li>If you choose to fight, and you survive, your HP ("healh score") will be adjusted, and you will gain treasure in the form of gold.</li>
            <li>If you choose to flee, the game ends, but you keep your gold.</li>
            <li>Whomever has the most gold (and survives) wins the game! Scores for former adventures are kept on the leaderboard.</li>
            <li>Ready to enter the dungeon and see how far you can make it?</li>
        </ul>
